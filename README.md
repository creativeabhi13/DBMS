The aim of this project is to create a functional application to manage the 
daily operations of apartments and simplify various aspects of apartment 
management such as rent collection, booking an apartment, availability 
of apartments etc that are normally very tedious to maintain using 
traditional methods.
This software helps them to digitize their records, which in turn saves a 
lot of time and money. For a manager or a company that owns multiple 
apartments, keeping track of each one is very difficult. They need to note 
down and maintain every detail for every apartment, keep track of 
apartments that are already booked, yet to be booked, payment status, 
etc. Expansion also bring in many challenges as their existing data need 
to be modified to reflect any additions.
In the proposed system, each tenant has his/her details stored in the 
database. The monthly rent can be entered for each resident which 
can save time. With this application, enable property managers to 
keep track and maintain records of their entire property easily. Any 
important information such as available blocks, flats, details of 
residents, rent paid can be found with just a click of a button
